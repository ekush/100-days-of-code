# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: day zero - outlined the project that I am going to do. Had a quick mock up on paper. I am still a bit confused about the tools to use.

**Thoughts:** Chosing a framework is always very difficult. But I think the main focus of this project is to aactually code and putting something out there so I should just start it.
