# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: day zero - outlined the project that I am going to do. Had a quick mock up on paper. I am still a bit confused about the tools to use.

**Thoughts:** Chosing a framework is always very difficult. But I think the main focus of this project is to aactually code and putting something out there so I should just start it.


### Day 1: January 13, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Day one - Started coding the html layout for my project idea. 

**Thoughts:** For me front end is always very challenging. I have tried to push myself a lot to code some css or js stuff, but always failed. Today I thought I would actually force myself to do this. Well, didn't go very well but sure some progress.
